    Perform the monte carlo run and estimate Pi.
    This works by:
    Selecting a random x and y co-ordinate between 0 and radius 1.
    Determining whether this co-ordinate would be located within a radius length.
    The ratio of hits within a radius length to the total number of hits is 1/4 of the value of Pi.

    The number of hits inside is representative of the area within a quadrant of that circle: (pi*r**2)/4.
    Let this be A.
    The number of hits total is representative of the area within a square: r**2.
    Let this be B.
    ((pi*r**2)/4)/(r**2) = A/B
